# SFT-QLM-Fine-tuning
Introduction

This code implements a workflow for fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) for Discriminative Prompt Objective (DPO) tasks. It leverages several techniques to enhance the LLM's performance and training efficiency:

Dialogue Data Preprocessing: The apply_chat_template function prepares dialogue data for DPO training, ensuring proper formatting for chosen and rejected responses, generation prompts, and handling edge cases.
SFT Adapter and Quantization: The code utilizes PeftModel to fine-tune the LLM with a Sparse Transformer (SFT) adapter, specializing it for DPO tasks. Additionally, quantization is implemented using BitsAndBytesConfig to potentially reduce memory footprint and improve inference speed on compatible hardware.
Gradient Accumulation and Checkpointing: The training process is configured with TrainingArguments to employ gradient accumulation, allowing for larger effective batch sizes while conserving memory. Checkpointing periodically saves model states during training, enabling continuation from specific points if needed.
Requirements

Python (tested with version X.X.X)
Transformers library (tested with version X.X.X)
Other dependencies (list any additional required libraries)
Installation

Create a virtual environment (recommended).

Install the required libraries:

Bash
pip install transformers [other_dependencies]
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Usage

Download and prepare your dialogue data.

Set the model_id variable in the code to the desired pre-trained LLM model identifier.

Adjust hyperparameters in TrainingArguments as needed.

Run the script:

Bash
python your_script.py
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Output

The fine-tuned LLM model will be saved in the specified output directory (output_dir).
Training logs and metrics will be generated during the process.
Additional Notes

Consider including links to relevant documentation for Transformers and other libraries used.
If applicable, provide instructions on how to use the fine-tuned model for inference tasks.
